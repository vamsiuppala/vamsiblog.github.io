# Snowflake VS Code Extension

I did not know this was possible. Most of my dev work is split into writing Python code in VS Code and SQL in Snowflakeâ€™s Snowsight UI. Turns out you could connect to your Snowflake warehouse using a [<u>Snowflake Extension for VS Code</u>](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/vscode-ext).

Steps to get you there:

## Fetch Account Details

Go to your Snowsight account, at the bottom left you should see an account indicator to get account information. Get the account URL from there

The URL should look like this:

https://\<account-identifier\>.snowflakecomputing.com

<!-- <span class="mark">https://\<account-identifier\>.snowflakecomputing.com</span> -->

<span class="mark">Copy the account-identifier.</span>

## Install Extension
Next, open VS Code and search for Snowflake in Extensions. Install it.

## Use Extension!

<span class="mark">Write your queries, save them, check history, play with the output tables, download into CSV, use CSV integration to edit results - endless possibilities.</span>

<span class="mark">Integrate git, make code repositories and make sure your whole team is on the same page with you with version controlling.</span>

## Life is great
