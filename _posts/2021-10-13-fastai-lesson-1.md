# fastai - lesson 1
[Lecture Video](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1)

### What do you need to get started?
* Very little math
* Small data is good enough
* Cheap computing expense
* Python - can learn as you go
* Some high school basic linear algebra


### What can you do with it?
* Apply DL in projects at work
* Bring DL into fields it otherwise hasn't been in


### What is DL?
* Started off as simple neural networks

### Approach
* Learn top-down
* Learn as you go
* Focus on projects

### How do neural networks work?
1. Inputs + Weights --(fed into-)-> Model --(spits out)--> Results
2. Results compared against Truth, and the "Performance" is computed
3. Performance is used to update Weights
4. Rinse and repeat Steps 1-3 until Performance is within acceptable range
5. The resulting 'Trained Model, with Tuned weights' can now be used to compute Results for unforseen data

* Steps 1 to 4 creates the "Model"
* Step 5 is using this created "Model"
