# Key Concepts
1. Architecture - the functional form of the model is called its architecture
2. Weights - parameters of the model
3. Independent variables - variables on which the predictions are calculated
4. Predictions - results of the model
5. Loss - measure of performance is called the loss, depends both on dependent variable and the weights
6. Target - dependent variable that is supposed to be predicted, but used for training through training set
7. SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) - a mechanism to update the weight assignments
