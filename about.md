# About

* My name is Vamsi and I am a Data Scientist at [Allbirds](https://www.allbirds.com/), bringing them to those who don't know of their existence, and helping sell some really good shoes to people who might want them.

* Earlier, I worked [Dun & Bradstreet](https://www.dnb.com/) helping the Advanced Analytics Team put ML models into production; and with [Axtria](https://www.axtria.com/) consulting with American Express' Small Merchant Risk team.

* I am interested in solving problems, primarily by using computation but anything shall do

* I have around six years of experience in helping companies across a broad range of industries make their data actionable. I've mostly worked in SQL (Snowflake / Hadoop) and Python. I'm also familiar with R and Looker.

* I completed my Masters in Industrial Engineering with a focus on Operations Research from Purdue University in Spring 2015. I recently completed a course on Deep Learning for practitioners at University of San Francisco.
