<!-- ## What you will find here

I try to write about what I learnt recently in my professional life as a Data Scientist. It is geared for the reader who is one step behind me. I was told that the best way to do that is to write to my alter ego from a few months ago. 
It turns out that writing down also helps me understand what I write better. -->
